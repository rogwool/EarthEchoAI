# Earth Echo AI 🌌📡

A conceptual framework and starter toolkit for training machine learning models on Earth’s electromagnetic emissions — designed to enhance the detection of Earth-like technosignatures in space.

## 🚀 Concept Overview

Modern SETI efforts scan the cosmos for anomalies that might suggest alien intelligence. Earth Echo AI flips this approach: by analyzing and modeling Earth’s own electromagnetic output — from satellite chatter to cultural broadcasts — we build a dynamic “technosignature profile” of intelligent activity.

This profile, gathered from outer space, can be used to:
- Train AI models to recognize structured, non-natural signals
- Search SETI archives for patterns resembling Earth’s emissions
- Explore what humanity might look like from afar — and who might look similar

## 🧠 What's Included

- `demo.ipynb`: A simple Jupyter Notebook showing how to load and visualize sample radio frequency data
- `scripts/signal_viewer.py`: Python script to generate FFT plots from radio data
- `data/`: Placeholder for Earth emissions and SETI-linked datasets
- `README.md`: You’re reading it!

## 🔬 Next Steps (Wish List)

- Integrate Breakthrough Listen data APIs
- Build supervised ML models using Earth's spectrum patterns
- Detect anomalies or signal similarities in SETI observations
- Create an interactive web dashboard for public exploration
- Launch a citizen science component for training and interpretation

## 🌍 Data Sources

- Earth samples: [RadioML datasets](https://www.deepsig.io/datasets), [SDR recordings](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/), [NOAA satellite streams](https://www.noaa.gov/)
- SETI samples: [Breakthrough Listen Archive](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/data.html), [SETI@home Legacy](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
